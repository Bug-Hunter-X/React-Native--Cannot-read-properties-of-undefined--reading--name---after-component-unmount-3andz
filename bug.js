This error occurs when you try to access a property of a component's state before the component has mounted or after it has unmounted.  This often happens in asynchronous operations, such as network requests or timers, that complete after the component has been removed from the React Native tree.

```javascript
// Buggy Code Example
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { data: null };
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(data => {
        // Potential error here if component unmounts before data arrives
        this.setState({ data });
      });
  }

  render() {
    if (this.state.data === null) {
      return <Text>Loading...</Text>;
    }
    return <Text>{this.state.data.name}</Text>;
  }
}
```
